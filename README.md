#Data Automation Using Cloud Computing And IOT

## Overview
This project provides a visual dashboard that retrieves data from an **AWS DynamoDB** and displays it in an interactive user interface. The dashboard is hosted on **Streamlit Cloud** for easy access and interaction. The main goal is to provide real-time or historical data analysis, leveraging AWS cloud services for backend storage and Streamlit for the front-end dashboard.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── dashboard.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
```

### File Descriptions:

- **`dashboard.py`**: This is the main Python file that integrates with DynamoDB, processes the data, and displays it on the Streamlit dashboard.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains all the necessary dependencies and libraries required for the project.
- **`README.md`**: This file, which provides project details and setup instructions.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project locally or deploying it to Streamlit Cloud, you need to set up the following:

- **AWS Account**: You need access to AWS DynamoDB.
- **AWS SDK (boto3)**: This project relies on `boto3` for interacting with DynamoDB.
- **Streamlit Account**: To deploy the dashboard on Streamlit Cloud.

### Required Libraries

The project uses several Python libraries. You can install them using the `requirements.txt` file.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-repo.git
cd project-repo
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

Use the following command to install all required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration for AWS DynamoDB:

You need to set up your AWS credentials so that `boto3` can access DynamoDB. Follow these steps to configure your AWS CLI:

- Install AWS CLI (if not already installed): [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- Configure your AWS CLI with `aws configure`:
  
  ```bash
  aws configure
  ```

- Enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Access Key, and the default region.

### 4. Running the Dashboard Locally:

To run the dashboard locally, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

This will start a local Streamlit server and provide a URL in your terminal, where you can view the dashboard on your browser.

### 5. Deploying on Streamlit Cloud:

- Push the project to GitHub (if not already done).
- Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/).
- Link your GitHub repository and deploy the app directly to Streamlit Cloud.

## How It Works

- **DynamoDB**: The application connects to AWS DynamoDB using `boto3` and retrieves the data stored in the database.
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: The data is then visualized using Streamlit’s interactive widgets. The dashboard provides real-time or historical data analysis depending on your setup.
- The dashboard can include charts, tables, or custom visualizations for better data interpretation.

## Sample Visualizations

- **Line Graphs** for trend analysis.
- **Bar Charts** for categorical data comparison.
- **Tables** to display raw data.

You can customize the dashboard as per your requirements using Streamlit widgets.
